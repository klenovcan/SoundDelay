# SoundDelay
Delayed [ms] live sound from choosen input to choosen output. Using for example to sync sound and video for live output. Limitation is up to 4000ms = 4s.
I am using it for sync Stereo audio input line from audiomixpult and video from HD IP Webcam to HDMI output wich is connected to Hardware Encoder for streaming to YouTube.
For now is only simple tool, later ill be add some more things by my need.
